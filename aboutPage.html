        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love all things football, especially if it concerns the Cleveland Browns!</p>
        <p>I'm a major bookworm, ever since I was little I've always preferred the company of books to people.</p>
        <p>Art! I tried to get into painting but the shoe never quite fit, however I love drawing. I find it quite relaxing!</p>

        <h2>Favorite Foods</h2>
        <p>Brownies. I wish I could say I enjoyed something healthy like salad but your boy loves himself some brownies.</p>
        <p>Panko fried chicken with mashed potatoes are my jam! Throw some green beans on the side and you got a meal.</p>
        <p>There probably isn't anything I wouldn't do if offered chicken parmigana. It is the food of the God's.</p>
